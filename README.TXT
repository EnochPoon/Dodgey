Some notes about this prototype

- These won't be the actual sprites to use. I'm just using these ones temporarily so you know at least the main concept of the game.
- I mentioned before that some spikeballs would be in a parabolic function, but in this prototype, it's just turning at a constant rate
- There should be a highscore placed somewhere.
- There is also going to be a title page.
- Lots of other stuff are missing here
